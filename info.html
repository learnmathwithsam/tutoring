        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I am currently a freshman at the University of Michigan's College of Engineering, beginning my journey here in 2025.
        I'm making this site as a passion project more than anything, but if I can help even a single person it's all worth it.

        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>
        My goal with this site is to provide understandable lessons and practice material for many different AP and college courses.
        I will begin with Calculus 1, and depending on how that goes and how well this service is received, expand from there.
